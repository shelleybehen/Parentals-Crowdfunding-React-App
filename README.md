# React Crowdfunding Project Parentals - She Codes Plus 2021

The purpose of my website is to connect parents who are living in a different state to their children or loved ones.  With lockdowns and quarantine becoming more common, there are times when parents cannot be with their children when they need them most e.g. if they break an arm.  Parentals connects users in one state to users in their loved ones state so that they can be there to take a spare set of clothes to the hospital or just check up on them and make sure they are okay.
My target audience is parents, grandparents or even adult children who canâ€™t be there to help their parents set up their new mobile phone etc.
